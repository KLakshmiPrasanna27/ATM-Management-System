# 🏧 ATM Management System

## 📌 Overview

The ATM Management System is a Java-based desktop application that simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides users with a secure and interactive interface to perform essential banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, mini statements, and PIN changes.

The project is built using Java Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management. It demonstrates the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts, database connectivity, event handling, and user authentication.
